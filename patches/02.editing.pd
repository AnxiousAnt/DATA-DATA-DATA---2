#X text 32 323 Edit mode also lets you make and break connections between
objects. Put the "hand" cursor over a line connecting two objects:
it turns into an X. Clicking will delete the connection. Hold the cursor
over an outlet and it becomes a circle (a patch point). Drag to any
box and release-- you will be connected to the nearest inlet.;
#X text 32 401 There are several handy tools in the "Edit" menu. You
can use the "Duplicate" menu item to create new objects by duplicating
existing ones. You can also "Cut" and "Paste" them. If you duplicate
several connected objects the connections will be replicated too.;
#X text 32 468 Also have a look in the "Put" menu-- use it to create
new text items of any of the four types. You can also put a "symbol"
box \, analogous to a number box but for showing and entering text
strings \, as well as other objects with more sophisticated graphical
user interfaces.;

#X text 17 28 Notice that some of the menu items have shortcut keys
listed beside them. Check out the one for Edit mode for a quick way
to switch back and forth between Edit mode and Run mode.;

#X text 33 107 When you first open a Pd document like this one \, your
cursor will be an arrow. Select "Edit Mode" in the "Edit" menu and
the cursor will change to the image of a hand. The patch is now in
Edit mode. You can move any object by dragging it.;
#X text 33 173 Select "Edit Mode" again in the "Edit" menu and you're
back to the arrow cursor which acts on objects without moving them.
;
#X text 33 215 In Edit Mode \, if you click on a message \, object
\, or comment \, you can then retype the text. For objects this will
create a new object and delete the old one. Pd will try to reconnect
the newly created object in the same way as the old one.;
