#X text 95 78 When you call an abstraction by typing \, say \, "sendnumber
1 x" in an object box. the subpatch can access the values of the creation
arguments (1 and x) as "\$1" and "\$2" innside object boxes. Typing
\$1 inside a message box has a different meaning (see the message box
help window.);
#X text 96 21 This window is used by 11.subpatch.pd to demonstrate
the abstraction mechanism in Pd. If you've opened this window directly
\, you might also want to open the other one to see how it's used.
