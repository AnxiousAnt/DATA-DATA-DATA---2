here's a pd patch:


<patch>


i'm creating a dataset to fine-tune an LLM to generate pd patch from natural language requests. i want you to do the following two things.
- create a brief instruction message for each patch. i. e if i wanted to ask someone to create that particular patch for me how would i ask them?
- lastly, create a response message, it should contain a crisp explanation of the patch

respond in ONLY JSON format. use this template: template = {
  "Instruction": "",
  "Response": ""
}
